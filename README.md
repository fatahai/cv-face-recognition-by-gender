# **PROJECT CV 1: FACE RECOGNITION**

Supported by: Indonesia AI - Computer Vision Specialist Bootcamp Batch 3

1. Amar Ma'ruf (VGG)
2. Bayuzen Ahmad (GoogLeNet)
3. Benedictus Dikha Arianda (VGG)
4. Dika Mahendra

\
The following are the results of creating a gender detection model using the CelebA dataset. The model built is a deep learning model from pre-trained models that have been tested globally. The pre-trained models used are the VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet models.

\
Objective:
\
Create a gender detection model with the most optimal results from the VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet models, and the evaluation metric used is the F1 Score. The F1 Score target is more than 90%.

\
Working Method:
1. Each person works independently according to the assigned model.
2. Each person experiments on the assigned model until they get optimal results.
3. The optimal results of each model will be compared with the optimal results of other models.
4. From the three compared models (VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet), the model with the highest F1 score was selected as the final model used for the gender detection model.

\
Here I was assigned to create and experiment on the GoogLeNet model until I got optimal results. This repository contains the results of my independent work and the final results of the team's work.
